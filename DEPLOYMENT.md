# Netlify Deployment Guide - Skids Vision

## Quick Deploy

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Recommended for first deployment)

1. **Build the project locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Drag the entire project folder** to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)

3. **Your app will be live immediately** with a random URL like `https://amazing-app-123.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended for ongoing development)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Skids Vision ready for deployment"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/skids-vision.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub and select your repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `.` (root directory)
     - **Node version**: 18 (in Environment variables)

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Your app will build and deploy automatically

## Configuration Details

### Build Settings
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `.` (root)
- **Node Version**: 18+ (set in Environment variables as `NODE_VERSION=18`)

### Environment Variables (if needed)
Currently, this app doesn't require environment variables, but you can add them in:
`Site settings > Environment variables`

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to `Site settings > Domain management`
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Performance Optimizations

The app includes several optimizations:

- **Service Worker**: For offline functionality and caching
- **PWA Manifest**: For app-like experience
- **Optimized Headers**: Security and caching headers in `netlify.toml`
- **Preloaded Resources**: Critical CSS and JS are preloaded

## Security Features

- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- XSS protection
- Frame-busting headers
- HTTPS enforcement (automatic on Netlify)

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor your app:

1. **Netlify Analytics**: Enable in site settings for basic analytics
2. **Deploy Logs**: Check build logs for any issues
3. **Form Handling**: If you add forms later, Netlify handles them automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build fails**: Check Node version in environment variables
2. **Camera not working**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled (automatic on Netlify)
3. **Service Worker issues**: Check browser console for SW errors
